          <b>How To Safely Dispose of Medical “Sharps”:</b> Many people in the
          community generate “sharps” (for example, used syringes) for a variety
          of reasons (for example, insulin-dependent diabetes). The Fire
          Department often gets phone calls asking if we can dispose of them for
          the public. The answer is that we cannot do so. That said, it is
          important to know how to properly and safely dispose of this material.
