          We are perfectly glad to try to put ourselves out of work. Help us help you by preventing and preparing for emergencies:

Medical
Recognize a heart attack or stroke and know when to call 911:
Warning Signs of a Heart Attack from the American Heart Association
Stroke Symptoms from the National Stroke Association
These websites also contain valuable information about choosing a healthier lifestyle to reduce your, or your loved ones', risk of having a heart attack or stroke.
Learn CPR and First Aid: Classes are regularly taught locally by the American Red Cross.
How To Safely Dispose of Medical “Sharps”: Many people in the community generate “sharps” (for example, used syringes) for a variety of reasons (for example, insulin-dependent diabetes). The Fire Department often gets phone calls asking if we can dispose of them for the public. The answer is that we cannot do so. That said, it is important to know how to properly and safely dispose of this material. This link will take you to the Tompkins County Health Department information on dealing with sharps. It contains information on collection sites, and a Frequently Asked Questions link which has a lot more useful information.
Fire
Fire Safety: Before, During, and After
The state of New York normally implements a ban on outdoor burning every spring. Look here for a heat map showing high risk areas based on current conditions. NY Fire Danger Map.
Install, and maintain, smoke detectors on every level of your home and both inside and outside of all sleeping areas. Read more information from the U.S. Fire Administration.
When a fire occurs, get out immediately, and never go back into a burning building for any reason. Make and practice a fire escape plan with your family. Read more information from the U.S. Fire Administration.
Take action to prevent a fire in your home.
The leading cause of home fires and of fire-related injuries is cooking, especially when cooking is left unattended (source).
The leading cause of fatal home fires is smoking materials discarded carelessly (source). More than one-third of the people killed in such fires are not the smokers whose cigarettes started the fire, but their children (source).
The second-leading cause of home fires, fire injuries and fire deaths is heating equipment.
Other frequent causes of fires are electrical equipment and candles.

Protect your family from carbon monoxide poisoning: Install CO alarms in your home and have your heating equipment serviced by a qualified technician every year. Read more information from the U.S. Fire Administration.
Make sure your house is clearly numbered to help us find you in an emergency. See the Fire Company's page about House Numbering for more information and to order reflective number signs.
